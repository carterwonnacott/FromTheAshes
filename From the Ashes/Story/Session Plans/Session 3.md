The PCs will be starting their journey [[Seeking out the Cult of Ceridwen (old Vulca)]]. 
## Session Start

At Session start, the party finds a note at the bedstand in their room at the Golden Goose Inn. The missive was left by Io's agent. An active watch may attempt a DC 16 Instinct check to detect the delivery. The message reads as follows:

> My fellow survivors, I hope this message finds you well-rested and recovered from our troubles in the south.
> Your first task is to go to the archive, find the ruins recorded there, and travel to the ruins by the appointed date. Be discreet.
> -I.C.
## Discovering the Location of the Temple of Ceridwen

There is a 10-tick clock to discover the location of the Temple of Ceridwen. If a PC is in the archive of a temple and tries to discover information about the ruins, they may make an action roll of an appropriate trait (likely Intellect). If they are at the temple of [[Vulca]] or of [[Belua & Ultor]], the DC will be 12 as the archives at these temples contain more relevant information; other temples will have a DC of 15. A success advances the research clock one tick and every 5 above the DC advances the clock another tick. Hope may give the players advantage on their next research check, and Fear may advance the suspecting librarian's clock or Pythagorus' clock (you may choose other consequences as appropriate, of course). 
### The Suspecting Librarian
In the archive of any given temple, there will be an archivist available to assist them. However, as temple priests, they are on the lookout for heretics. They may be recruited to help with the research, but PCs must be careful not to hint at the true nature of their research. See [[Suspecting Librarian]] for more information.
## Wanted for Murder: Pythagorus

Pythagorus, in a desperate attempt to escape capture by temple guards, killed one of the temple guards. All guards are now on the alert for Pythagorus, and the fellow to the guard that was killed has sworn vengeance. There is a 6-tick clock for the guards to discover Pythagorus' location. Advance the clock whenever Pythagorus walks by a guard post or interacts with people. When the clock fills up, a team of guards consisting of a [[Head Guard]], a [[Bladed Guard]], the [[Vengeful Guard]], and an [[Archer Guard]] descend on Pythagorus' location.
