The archivists at the temples of [[Moenia Maris]] are always on the lookout for heretics. Although they will only report suspects with real evidence (or with a real grudge), they will go out of their way to hinder suspicious types. They try to help pious followers stay away from pagan influence.

### Moves
##### Guided Studies
While the suspecting librarian is more than happy to help any individual find research material, they do not wish to catalyze apostasy. If a player is researching pagan material, they must make a check to convince the librarian that they are of pure intent. A success grants the player advantage on their next check to research with the librarian's assistance, and a failure imposes disadvantage on their next research check as the librarian subtly impedes their studies through misguided information, misplaced materials, etc.
