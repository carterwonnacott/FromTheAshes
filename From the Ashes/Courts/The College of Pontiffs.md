## Rival Dreams
After the events of [[The Eruption of Dun Frea]], the College became divided as to whether a new Supreme Pontiff should be appointed. 
## Iron Law
During the events of [[The Founding of Imperium Deum]], the First Pontiff sealed [[Vulca]] with a pact: [[Vulca]] may only use her powers to deliver the messages of the gods, and the gods and their followers cannot harm [[Vulca]] and hers. Now, it is only a small grievance if an ignorant follower of the gods were to harm a follower of [[Vulca]], but the College is not ignorant of this pact or of the effect they have on this world, and so they are near powerless to stop the recent revival of [[Vulca]]'s cult. Were the College to actively eliminate the cult, they would be in danger of voiding the pact entirely.
