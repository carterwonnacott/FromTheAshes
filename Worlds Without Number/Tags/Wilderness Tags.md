# Abandoned Village
Wilderness villages tend to be unstable “gold rush” settlements in the best of times, attracting those who lack any sound place elsewhere. This village failed as rapidly as it was formed. It may have been overrun by marauders, depopulated by disease, hollowed out by a failed harvest, torn apart by civil strife, or just abandoned for better prospects elsewhere.

| **Enemies** | Bandit chief or sorcerer responsible for the ruin, Crazed village head turned hermit, Monstrous entity nesting in the remains |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Last stubborn holdout, Lord’s bailiff looking for answers, Hapless pioneer who’s arrived to an empty ruin |
| **Complications** | It’s now populated by something inhuman, It was built on top of a place abandoned for good reason, The wilderness is reclaiming it in a dangerous way |
| **Things** | Heirloom left behind in the flight, Buried treasure of the villagers, The relic that caused the ruin |
| **Places** | Overgrown village meeting hall, Home with everything left just as it was at that moment, Burnt-out shrine to the local god |

# Ancient Guardians
There are guardians in this site derived from some ancient polity, whether constructs built to protect some long-forgotten place here or the restless shades of the dead who once dwelled in the location. They may have a simple hatred towards “invaders” or they may be confused, thinking interlopers are part of some ancient enemy group. What they once guarded may not even exist any more in any perceptible way.

| **Enemies** | Unrelenting golem leader, Maddened sorcerer-lord shade, Sinister heir seeking to suborn the guardians to their service |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Diplomatic guardian entity, Greedy treasure-hunter, Local who got trapped in the place |
| **Complications** | The guardians are to keep something in, A local group uses the guardians as a trap for outsiders, The guardians were never meant to be harmful but what they do to intruders is very damaging |
| **Things** | Key to shut down or ward off the guardians, The precious relic they were guarding, Ritual garb that makes the wearer invisible to the guardians |
| **Places** | Place of ominously martial statuary, Ghostly street-image of a vanished place, Broken remnant of an ancient landmark |

# Ancient Monument
A grand monument to some ancient polity is found here. While its actual meaning and significance may be inscrutable, it’s probably big enough and dramatic enough to dominate the hex, even if it’s collapsed or been defaced by the ages. The remains of the civilization that raised it might be found at its base, along with whatever heirs to it remain. Some monuments still have active enchantments or guardians to prevent defacement.

| **Enemies** | Zealous modern cultist of the vanished polity, Last bitter heir of them, Vile monster that nests in the monument |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Eager archaeologist, Weary old hereditary keeper of the place, Friendly creature that’s made the monument a home |
| **Complications** | The monument is a powerful Working, The monument served a secular or residential purpose, The bulk of the monument is underground or in an extradimensional pocket Iterum |
| **Things** | Costly decorations or ornaments on the monument, The precious core of the work, Ancient offerings made to it by vanished supplicants |
| **Places** | Before some towering megastructure-monument, Amid the cyclopean wreckage of its fall, Secret passages within the monument |

# Arratu Land
There is a large pocket of arratu at the site, even though it may be too small to show up on the hex map. Such a pocket might be the last remnant of a formerly-great swath, or it could just be a localized tumor created by an Outsider device, a malevolent sorcerer, or a magical disaster. Something about the arratu’s placement likely forces the party to go well out of their way to bypass it safely; it might command a narrow pass or be flanked by dangerous terrain on either side.

| **Enemies** | Outsider beast within the waste, Half-human marauder chief lairing inside, Crazed Outsider wizard who made the wasteland |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Foolish explorer who tried to cross it, Wretched slave taken by raiders, Not-too-homicidal native |
| **Complications** | The wasteland is being contained by a potentially-breakable object here, Locals know how to get through it safely, It’s a very new wasteland and the locals haven’t adjusted to it yet |
| **Things** | Equipment to survive the hostile atmosphere within, Precious Outsider relic, Wealth seized by raiders from the waste |
| **Places** | Blasted village overrun by alien life, Desolate plain with an unearthly sky above, Lakeshore of a pool filled with a noxious chemical |
# Bandit Lair
Bandits lair in this hex, which is presumably close enough to civilized lands to serve as a base for their operations. Not every bandit lair is a hidden cave; some operate out of subverted or cowed villages, others hide among remote monasteries, and some just camp in convenient glades long enough to rest, refit, and trade with black marketeers. It might be a seasonal lair as well, with local peasants turning bandit at certain profitable times of the year.

| **Enemies** | Ruthlessly pragmatic bandit chief, Wealthy grandee wielding the bandits against rivals, Heartless slaver gathering stock |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Hapless missionary of a kinder way, Local taken as a slave, Runaway bandit who repents |
| **Complications** | They have a traditional prey and don’t usually rob others, They’re the degenerate remnants of a once-noble cause, They’re a confederacy of thieving groups that often quarrel |
| **Things** | Loot taken from a recent success, Priceless heirloom owned by a noble-turned-bandit, Precious relic the bandits don’t realize is so valuable |
| **Places** | Raucous glade full of drink and debauchery, Repurposed estate, Makeshift palisaded camp |

# Beast Swarm
There is a swarm of some dangerous beast in the area, whether it consists of a tide of minuscule vermin or a pack of magically-warped predators. Some of these swarms may serve more as environmental hazards than monsters to be fought; sweeping carpets of mutated radioactive fire ants might be something for the PCs to dodge rather than engage. If the beasts have some mundane value, they might have attracted suitably reckless interest from the locals.

| **Enemies** | Supernaturally intelligent god-beast, Mad wizard who spawned them, Brutal hunt master driving his wretched minions on |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Victim of a beast attack, Animal collector on a mission, Hunter in search of vengeance |
| **Complications** | The beasts are usually harmless but have recently changed, The beasts are the only thing holding a worse peril back, The beasts gain magical powers in sufficiently large groups |
| **Things** | Poison that is very lethal to the beasts, Relic that can control the swarms, Priceless treasure held by a luckless hunter |
| **Places** | Site of a bestial massacre, Fetid den of a swarm, Overrun hunter’s camp |

# Blighted Tribe
A tribe of Blighted live in the hex. They may be violent war-creatures naturally hostile to normal humanity or beings cursed with some trait or nature that makes it impossible for them to live in civilization. Relations are unlikely to be warm in either case, but the latter might be persuaded to parley if the party can work around their limitations and win their trust.

| **Enemies** | Brutal Blighted war-chief, Outsider using them as living tools, Human hunter bent on slaughtering inoffensive Blighted |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Native not so Blighted as their brethren, Human trader who deals with them, Local human who knows their ways |
| **Complications** | Their blight was once very useful to the ancient polity that existed here, They’re only Blighted because they lack something to temper it that this site once provided, They’re dying out and desperate to win allies against their many predators |
| **Things** | Valuable Blighted-made product, Relics of those who twisted them, Trophies taken from their prey |
| **Places** | Human structure reworked to fit their nature, Site of a gruesome massacre, Shrine or monument honoring their creators |

# Broken Infrastructure
There is a ruin here that once enabled some grand ancient infrastructure. A lost canal lock, irrigation control center, magical gate nexus, weather control station, underground transit station, occult communications center, or some other great function was once performed here. The ruin has been unusable for ages, but remnants of its former function might still be found in the surroundings.

| **Enemies** | Sorcerer looting the wreckage, Monstrous remnant of the former inhabitants or guardians, Modern parasite-monster come to feed on the scraps |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Curious arcane student, Tribal who lives in the ruin, Wayfarer forced to seek refuge there |
| **Complications** | It still works but in a dangerous and unhelpful way, It would cause a tremendous local disaster if it were re-activated, The locals are exploiting it in an unintended fashion |
| **Things** | Control key for the original function, Relic related to the original function that does something magical, Precious component from it |
| **Places** | Long-ruined control nexus, Collapsed service or operational area, Surrounding area scarred by the decayed remnants of its function |
# Chokepoint
There’s a natural choke point in this area: a mountain pass, a land bridge, a dry ridge in a swamp, a narrow strand of untainted arratu land, a gap in a megastructure, or some other slender passage. Such a chokepoint is likely part of a feature that extends outside the hex, and it may be prohibitively difficult to cross this feature anywhere else. Such valuable, defensible areas are rarely left unoccupied.

| **Enemies** | Bandit lord who “taxes” passersby, Monstrous creature who hunts there, Ancient guardian of a long-dead polity |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Trader in dire need, Explorer seeking a better way, Local currently inhabiting the chokepoint |
| **Complications** | It can be opened or blocked by a controller, It’s only recently become abnormally dangerous, It’s known only by those who want it kept secret |
| **Things** | Map of the passage, Token allowing safe passage, Key to controlling the passage |
| **Places** | Perfect ambush site, Natural fortress, High observation point commanding the pass |

# Collapsed Deep
An ancient Deep once was located here, but time, warfare, or disaster caused it to collapse. A significant portion of the surface has likely subsided to form an uneven crater. Small sections of the Deep might still be accessible from the surface, and dangerous uncollapsed passageways may still connect these smaller zones. The heirs of the survivors may still persist on the surface or they may have long since died out to natural hazards or dispersion.

| **Enemies** | Buried undying lord, Surface looter with dreams of rule, The thing that caused the collapse |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Friendly survivor descendant, Curious explorer, Native guide to the ancient pit |
| **Complications** | Things below are digging their way up, The Deep is leaking something dangerous, The collapse was recent and monstrous survivors still flee |
| **Things** | Priceless Deep treasure cast up, Exposed arcane components, Potent relic carried by survivors |
| **Places** | Ancient vault torn in two, Crevasse cutting through a hundred ruined levels, Buckled structure fragment jutting through the surface |

# Criminal Meet
This site is used as a meeting place for smugglers, bandits, illegal slavers, fences, or other criminals. Something about the place gives them a good view of any incoming strangers and discreet privacy for their dealings. Some few criminals may remain here at all times to maintain the place, or it might be used only as the situation requires. These criminals may be particular, dealing only with known associates, or they may be far enough from the law to feel comfortable about trading with adventurers.

| **Enemies** | Corrupt merchant grandee, Sinister black market boss, Monstrous entity that enforces the meet’s peace |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Theft victim searching for their goods, Frustrated local lawman, Merchant with suspicions about a fence |
| **Complications** | The local authorities turn a knowing blind eye to it, The meet is trading in something much worse than everyone thinks it is, Significant amounts of stolen goods are stored there |
| **Things** | Valuable smuggled contraband, Cache of stolen goods, Precious object that’s very hard to fence |
| **Places** | Concealed cave storehouse, Rocky observation point, Sheltered glade in a thick forest |
# Cryptic Art
A vast ancient work of art has been raised here, back when the wilderness was not so wild. It may be a statue or other sculpted monument, perhaps of entities in no way human, or it may be fashioned of solid light, sound, emotions, or stranger media. The intended meaning of this art is usually incomprehensible to modern humanity and the structure is too large or too difficult to harm for ordinary vandals or time to have erode it entirely. Some ancient forms of art can be dangerous or even lethal to modern humans.

| **Enemies** | Ancient site guardian, Priest of a cult that’s made a religion of the art, Sorcerer bent on suborning a magical artwork |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Reckless art connoisseur, Native living in the artwork, Historian trying to decipher it |
| **Complications** | It has a positive or negative effect on a viewer’s body or mind, It’s been warped into something monstrous by time or decay, It encodes a terrible or precious secret to those who understand it |
| **Things** | Ancient texts that can decode the art’s meaning, Precious object used in its construction, Fragment of damaged art that’s still valuable |
| **Places** | Intended viewing site for the art, Churning inner mechanism of a complex work, Hidden chamber revealing a different perspective of the work |
# Cursed Land
This hex is afflicted by a malevolent curse, distorting the natural order and posing a persistent danger to those who venture into it. The curse might manifest in warped creatures, plagued inhabitants, or a pervasive aura of misfortune. Despite the danger, there is something valuable or attractive within the cursed land, drawing the interest of those willing to face the peril.

| **Enemies** | Vile sorcerer responsible for the curse, Hideously-warped native creature, Curse-beast that sweats the malison with its very existence |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Local curse victim, Native sorcerer trying to lift it, Hapless pioneer who didn’t realize it was there |
| **Complications** | It has a seemingly positive effect as well, The seemingly obvious source of the curse isn’t at all responsible, Someone profits by the curse |
| **Things** | Ward to protect against the curse, Precious byproduct of the magic, Key to undoing the curse |
| **Places** | Warped and twisted natural feature, Nest of misshapen beasts, Field of grossly-mutated plant life |

# Decayed Working
An ancient magical Working in the area has decayed, twisting its original purpose into something dangerous. What was once meant to bring good fortune, health, or swift travel now creates ill luck, plagues, or summons extradimensional horrors. Repairing the Working might end the problem or unleash even greater magical chaos. The locals might have found ways to contain the decay, or they endure it as a necessary evil to keep outsiders at bay.

| **Enemies** | Working-born abomination, Ancient caretaker gone berserk, Sorcerer tearing apart the Working recklessly for lore and parts |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Native who knows how to live with the blight, Ambitious would-be repairman, Curious scholar looking for details |
| **Complications** | The decay can be contained with vile or costly rituals by the locals, The decay is endured because it fends off outsiders, A local enemy wants to worsen the effect |
| **Things** | Parts to repair the Working, Valuable magical byproducts, Precious Working fragments |
| **Places** | Decaying Working chamber, Site twisted by the magical effect, Collapsed arcane structure |

# Demihuman Community
In this hex, there's a community of demihumans, deliberately maintaining autonomy by avoiding more civilized lands. The demihumans might have reasons for avoiding human territories, whether cultural differences, remnants of a former kingdom, or a need to keep humans safe from them. They coexist with their surroundings, and their isolation might be enforced for the sake of privacy.

| **Enemies** | Crazed demihuman leader, Sinister demihuman cult priest, Tyrannical government viceroy |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Xenophilic local demihuman, Human trader with lasting ties, Human who’s “gone native” |
| **Complications** | They’re apart to keep humans safe from them rather than them safe from humans, They’re remnants of a former demihuman kingdom, They’re responsible for many local wilderness dangers to maintain their privacy |
| **Things** | Precious good created by demihumans, Inherited relic of the ancestors, Tribute owed to the local ruler |
| **Places** | Ceremonial structure of a former age, Village hidden cunningly, Well-guarded wall against outsiders |

# Devil Grove
While not a complete arratu, a glade or zone within this hex is infested with Outsider flora and fauna, creating a perilous environment. The grove might be restrained from growing rapidly by an ancient Outsider device or could be a tiny remnant of an ancient wasteland constrained by time and the Legacy. The area is home to hideous Outsider predators, blighted war chiefs, and ancient entities maintaining the grove.

| **Enemies** | Hideous Outsider predator, Blighted warchief hiding in the grove, Ancient Outsider maintaining the grove |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Hard-pressed pioneer, Local hunter harried by the beasts, Adventurer seeking the grove’s cause |
| **Complications** | Local rustics sacrifice to the grove to placate its denizens, The grove is valued as a natural defense against a neighboring threat, Exiles and criminals seek refuge there |
| **Things** | Precious byproduct of alien life, Outsider relic in the heart of the grove, Valuable goods on a victim of the beasts |
| **Places** | Glen swollen with uncanny life, Windy vale streaked with plumes of alien air, Shore of a pond full of some noxious chemical |
# Disused Mine
A mine of some kind once existed here. While shaft mines with tunnels and galleries are the common type for present-day delvings, ancient strip mines here may have peeled off whole mountainsides or exposed some massive megastructure that was stripped for parts in a prior, lost age. The forgotten mines of a prior era might have left tailing piles or trace deposits that are valuable to a more depleted age.

| **Enemies** | Crazed wildcat miner, Thing from delving too deep, Undead and tireless mine boss |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Eager prospector, Native dwelling in the mines, Ancient friendly mining automaton |
| **Complications** | They were mining a buried civilization rather than ores, Groups are fighting over control of the mine, The mine was partially re-purposed for the needs of a group of natives |
| **Things** | Motherlode of precious materials, Storehouse of refined product, Map to a virgin strike |
| **Places** | Massive pitch-black subterranean gallery, Mound made of centuries worth of tailings, Still-poisoned land in a processing waste zone |


# Healing Terrain
This site borders a shrinking arratu, one being slowly driven back by the Legacy, the work of human hands, or some native life form that’s capable of successfully competing with the alien life. There are usually some pioneers or scavengers trying to take advantage of the shrinking waste, either to work the newly-arable land or plunder the ruins its receding tide reveals.

| **Enemies** | Furious and frustrated Outsider wastemaker, Monstrous beast in too small a hunting ground, Local tyrant seeking dominion over the new pioneers |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Plucky new colonist, Earnest professional mender of wastes, Luckless soldier sent to defend the new locals |
| **Complications** | The shrinking wastes are revealing a lost human city below, As the waste shrinks its effects are getting more concentrated inside it, The receding zone is opening a safe path for old enemies to strike the new holdings |
| **Things** | Treasures long lost within the waste, Possessions cherished by a now-dead pioneer, Precious product of the alien flora that now grows scarce |
| **Places** | Half-warped glade where alien life is losing, Newly-built steading, Exposed ancient structure |

# Hermitage
A small hermitage was established here sometime in the past to provide solitude for some ascetic. Occasionally small clusters of hermits form around such a central point, meeting at times to check on each other or join in shared discipline. Such anchorites usually shun visitors who aren’t also devotees of their path, but occasionally a hermit wins such fame for sorcery or wisdom that pilgrims seek them out. Some hermits have been known to respond with great anger toward these repeated worldly interruptions.

| **Enemies** | Hermit sorcerer gone mad, Sinister villain hiding as a hermit, Alien hermit with inscrutably evil philosophical principles |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Worried relative of a new hermit, Petitioner seeking holy help, Hermit rethinking solitude |
| **Complications** | The hermits have control over a local magical energy or Working, They keep themselves separate to keep others safe from them and their irrepressible powers, The hermit is hated by the local secular authorities for their aid to its foes |
| **Things** | Precious religious relic carried by the hermit, Cast-off worldly wealth, Map to finding them |
| **Places** | Austere wilderness cave, Hermit hole in a gravemound in the swamps, Tall and narrow stone column for sitting on |

# Historical Survival
Some small community or remnant group of an ancient empire persists here. They may have been a colony planted before the empire’s fall, an outside group that inherited the culture after conquest or subsumption, a chronological distortion cast out of time, a group held in stasis that recently awoke, or some other remnant of a greater past. They may or may not have a clear idea of the present world, but may preserve knowledge of now-lost strongholds and points of power once held by their ancestors.

| **Enemies** | Embittered revanchist ruler, Vengeful chieftain who blames the world, Transhuman leader of incomprehensible cognition |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Heritor curious about outsiders, Desperate chief in need of outside help, Determined preserver of ancient identity |
| **Complications** | The empire they belonged to was infamous, They’re only notionally human, They make deals with rebels and exiles of neighboring lands |
| **Things** | Long-preserved ancient regalia, Now-lost relic in common use in their empire, Secret lore to unlock hidden storehouses of their people |
| **Places** | Crumbling and dilapidated public building, Crude shrine with too-advanced salvaged ornaments, Passages kept secret from the
# Isolated Academy
This hex is home to an isolated academy, where sorcerers, esoteric artists, hermit-scholars, and other educators pursue their studies. The academy may have once been the heart of an ancient city or possess unique magical and aesthetic qualities. The subjects studied might be unconventional or even abhorrent to mainstream civilization. The academy, largely self-sufficient, retains ties to the outer world.

| **Enemies** | Sinister headmaster, Powerful instructor with a dark purpose, Monstrous thing the academy serves |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Sympathetic young student, Pilgrim aspiring to be admitted, Harried instructor needing help |
| **Complications** | It has two curricula with the second being much darker and known only to initiates, It’s protected by its terrible patron power, An awful sacrifice is demanded of some or all students |
| **Things** | Tome of secret lore they’ve developed, Magical object they’ve created, Key to bypassing the academy’s defenses |
| **Places** | Mundanely-impossible lecture hall, Artistic work of inhuman nature, Site scorched and blasted by their mistakes or training errors |

# Labyrinthine Tangle
The terrain in this hex is an intricate and treacherous labyrinth, making it almost impossible to navigate without a guide or a detailed map. The tangle could result from shifting, boggy ground, overgrown forests, or magical miasmas. Spatial distortions born of ancient magic might create regions where only the right keys allow passage.

| **Enemies** | Sinister master of the labyrinth, Monstrous creature born of the wild, Savage exile hiding in the maze |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Helpful local guide, Hapless soul lost within it, Friendly native of the maze |
| **Complications** | Getting lost in it can leave you very far from your entry point, An environmental hazard harms you more the longer you stay in it, Guides sacrifice certain clients to the powers within |
| **Things** | Map of the labyrinth, Treasure lost by a victim within it, Precious object the labyrinth guards |
| **Places** | Trail that looks like all the rest, Trees or cliffs too difficult to scale blocking out any distant view, Ancient megastructure with perfectly identical massive decorative fragments that form a maze |

# Lost Battlefield
This hex bears the scars of a terrible battle from the past, with remnants that hint at the conflict's nature. Undead might roam the area, or ancient weapons could have left a lasting impact. Locals may reenact the battle ritually or earnestly, and unexploded ancient munitions could pose a threat. The battlefield might hold potent weapons, precious treasures, or the bones of a sainted hero.

| **Enemies** | Looter-archaeologist and his minions, Undying warlord, Relentless ancient automaton |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Curious scholar from afar, Heir to one of the warring sides, Ancestral caretaker of the field |

| **Places** | Hasty and makeshift tomb of a war leader, Land churned up by ancient war magic, Vast burial mound amid a bleak plain |

# Lost City
The remnants of an ancient city lie hidden within this hex, shrouded by overgrowth. Whether it was once part of a lost empire or a more recent community consumed by wilderness, the city's former inhabitants avoid its site for some pressing reason. Magical aftershocks, taboo, or an unrevealed evil might plague the city, and survivors or ancient city servitors may still linger.

| **Enemies** | The terrible creature that destroyed it, Vengeful wraith of its last ruler, Savage chieftain who’s taken it for his seat of rule |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Shy survivor of the original population, Local native who dares to enter it, Ancient city servitor who still functions |
| **Complications** | The city is plagued with magical aftershocks of the mighty sorcery that destroyed it, The city was smashed before its inhabitants could do a great evil, It’s taboo ground for the nearby locals |
| **Things** | Ancient city vault’s treasures, Precious relic of the dead, Fragment of the thing that ruined it |
| **Places** | Desolate street half-buried by earth and decay, City monument worn into illegibility, Wreckage of the catastrophic death of the city |
# Magical Springs
Within this hex lies an enchanted spring, its powers derived from an ancient Working or influenced by ambient magical currents. Creatures that drink from it may be blessed with special graces, but equally, sinister consequences may accompany the act. The local flora and fauna have likely been significantly altered by the spring's effects. Most such springwater loses its powers if separated from the main body for an extended period.

| **Enemies** | Beast warped by the spring’s power, Ruthless sorcerer experimenting with its effects, Barbaric chieftain using it to advance his power |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Ancestral guardian of the spring, Pioneer plagued by the spring’s effects, Scholar who thinks they can fix any negative effects of the spring |
| **Complications** | The spring grants a blessing that comes with a substantial cost, The spring’s blessing becomes a curse when over-imbibed, The spring’s created an entire ecosystem of servitor-addicts |
| **Things** | Cure for the changes the spring forces, Vessel that can hold the springwater without losing its power, Precious fragment of the original Working |
| **Places** | Pool of obviously uncanny water, Shore marked with the spring’s effects, Weird den of a springtouched beast |

# Migration Path
This hex is a part of a migration path for a formidable assembly of dangerous creatures, crossing the area at specific times of the month or year. The migration may serve various purposes such as reaching underground entrances, moving between feeding sites, or immersing themselves in a critical magical aura or ancient radiation. Despite the dangers, there must be something valuable in this area that attracts outsiders when the living tide arrives.

| **Enemies** | Monstrously huge alpha of the tide, Cultist who worships the creatures of the tide, Sorcerer trying to bend the swarm to his will |
| ------- | --- |
| **Friends** | Treasure seeker daring the migration schedule, Scholar of these beasts, Local trapped here at the wrong time |
| **Complications** | The tide’s schedule is dangerously unpredictable, The creatures are always present but only become dangerous during the migration, The migration path changes very often |
| **Things** | Precious animal byproduct of the swarm, Treasure found by a too-slow seeker, Key to predicting or controlling the swarm |
| **Places** | Trail stripped bare by the tide, Massive breeding ground, Island full of cowering refugees |
