Dun Iega, or the Crescent Isles, are a chain of three islands that curve from north to south, curving to create a crescent shape facing eastward. From north to south, the names of these islands are [[Fredun]], [[Twendun]], and [[Andun]]. The islands are also divided in a northerly/southerly manner by a range of imposing mountains, further dividing the chain into the [[Inner Crescent]] and [[Outer Crescent]].
